            <p>
              In a nutshell, oxDNA is a simulation code that models nucleic acid behavior
              (DNA and RNA) at a coarse-grained level. The original model was introduced by
              T. E. Ouldridge, J. P. K. Doye, and A. A. Louis, and has evolved into an
              extensible simulation and analysis framework supporting oxDNA1, oxDNA2, oxRNA,
              and oxNA force fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              oxDNA can run both molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
              MD runs on CPUs or CUDA-enabled GPUs, while MC can use algorithms like Virtual
              Move Monte Carlo to accelerate equilibration and sampling. By simulating many
              nucleotides over time, it is possible to accurately determine average
              thermodynamic and mechanical behavior across systems ranging from simple duplexes
              to massive DNA origami assemblies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using a coarse-grained model to determine DNA behavior is quite different from
              approaches like all-atom molecular dynamics. Each method has strengths and
              limitations depending on the scientific question.

            <p>
              In order to do anything, the code first needs a model of some problem of
              interest. This could be a simple DNA duplex, a Holliday junction, or a complex
              DNA origami nanorobot. You describe the model so the code can run simulation and
              analysis.

              The oxDNA project has grown far beyond a single simulation engine. It is now a
              rich ecosystem of interconnected tools designed to help design, simulate, and
              analyze nucleic acid nanotechnology workflows.

              To begin, you just need to go to OxView to visualize and edit your structure,
              and OxCloud to simulate it right in your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              To have fine-grained control over all the tools the oxDNA ecosystem has to
              offer, you will need to be a little proficient with the command-line interface
              (CLI) and git for staying up-to-date with the latest code developments.
            </p>
            <p>
              For advanced users, the oxpy (Python bindings) and oat APIs offer direct
              usability improvements over raw text inputs and outputs, enabling more
              fine-grained analysis and statistical calculations.
