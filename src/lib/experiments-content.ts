A DNA helix can crossover with one of its three neighbors at 7 bp intervals (corresponding to about 120 degrees of rotation) and with the same helix at 21 bp intervals (2 full turns of a DNA helix)[2,3]. The honeycomb lattice is the most popular for 3D origami and is thought to provide the most mechanically rigid arrangement. Compared to double stranded DNA, bundling of helices into a honeycomb pattern significantly increases the bending rigidity[4]. Per unit mass, honeycomb lattice creates origami with larger bending rigidity than square lattices due to a higher cross-section[5]. The honeycomb lattice cross over spacing complies with the natural B-form DNA twist density. Square lattice cross over spacing causes slight underwinding, and thus honeycomb lattices typically have less torsional strain than square lattices.",

This lattice arrangement is popular when flat surfaces are desired, like in 2D origami or origami being deposited on surfaces. The crossover spacing leads to a slight underwinding which can contribute to a right-handed global twist. Methods involving strategically placed insertions and deletions have been developed to compensate for and correct this twist[7].

            text: "DNA nanotechnology has been extensively studied as a biomedical platform and as a biophysical probe. For both, the DNA nanostructure can intentionally, or unintentionally, measure and perturb the biological material it is interacting with. There are many important considerations when designing DNA nanostructures for use with cells **in vitro** or **in vivo**. If you intend to work in physiological fluids containing serum or free-floating proteins, these proteins can non-specifically interact with your nanostructure and alter its intended shape and function[1]. In addition, DNA nanostructures are highly negatively charged so they will interact electrostatically with cell surface glycocalyx, proteins, and lipid membranes[2]. For anchoring structures onto cell surfaces, researchers often functionalize their nanostructure with hydrophobic moieties like cholesterol which insert into lipid membranes[3]. Compared to proteins, DNA origami synthesized using the standard M13mp18 scaffold are significantly larger, on the order of 100× the size of a typical protein. For this reason, many applications of DNA nanotechnology for biophysics rely on small multi-strand DNA complexes, like DNA tetrahedrons, which are likely to perturb cells less and are on the same size scale as proteins.",

            text: "For applications within cells, nanostructures must first be internalized. Given their hydrophilicity and highly negative charge this itself is often a challenge[2]. Improvements in uptake have been achieved by using transfection reagents[4] or adding molecules that bind nanostructures to cell surfaces[5]. When uptaken, they are typically engulfed into cells via scavenger receptors, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and caveolin-mediated endocytosis[6]. Nanostructure size, shape, aspect ratio, as well as other structural factors are known to play a role in uptake efficiency, however there is no clear consensus on the rules governing their uptake and it is likely cell-type specific[7]. Once inside the cell, nanostructures are in an environment with low levels of magnesium. The ionic concentrations in the cytoplasm are typically inconsistent with origami folding buffer and are often inadequate to maintain a stable structure.",

Ultrafiltration uses a semipermeable membrane with a defined molecular weight cut off (MWCO) to separate molecules above and below the size threshold. Molecules larger than the MWCO are retained while molecules smaller than the MWCO flow through. For DNA origami, the objective of ultrafiltration is to separate intact DNA nanostructures from excess staples which are small and pass through the filter. Typically, 100 kDa MWCO filters are used. Several rounds of ultrafiltration can be performed to increase purity, however recovery yield also decreases as successive rounds of filtration and washing are performed.",

While ultrafiltration is being performed, buffers including MgCl2 and Tris flow through and your final volume is less than your initial volume. This results in an increase in concentration of your origami which makes inter-origami interactions more favorable. It is also important to keep in mind that ultrafiltration will not remove free scaffold, aggregated origami, or dimerized origami as these all lie above the MWCO and will be retained. When high molar excess of staples are added, the concentration of free scaffold is typically assumed to be negligible. For single origami nanostructures, mechanical shearing is highly unlikely. However, for multi-component assemblies, shearing becomes a larger concern and ultrafiltration may not be compatible with these larger complexes.",

Briefly, PEG, a large and hydrophilic polymer, occupies significant solution volume and sterically excludes large DNA nanostructures from the same space as the PEG. This exclusion creates an osmotic pressure that concentrates the large nanostructures into a smaller volume and can precipitate them out of solution. DNA staples and salts are small enough such that they are not excluded by PEG and can occupy the same space, therefore they do not precipitate. Choosing the correct molecular weight PEG can affect your purification efficiency. PEG8k is a typical starting point for scaffolded origami around 4.5 MDa.
